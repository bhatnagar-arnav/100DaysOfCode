//Q105: Write a program to take an integer array nums of size n, and print the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears strictly more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. Print -1 if no such element exists. Note: Majority Element is not necessarily the element that is present most number of times.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
nums = [3,2,3]
Output 1:
3

Input 2:
nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output 2:
2

Input 3:
nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output 3:
-1
